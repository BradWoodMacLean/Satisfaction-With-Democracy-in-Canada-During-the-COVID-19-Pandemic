# Satisfaction with Democracy in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Abstract
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for citizen sacrifices and compliance with public health measures led to varied reactions across Canada. This project examines the polarizing effects these measures had on public satisfaction with democracy. Employing regression analyses that integrate rolling survey data, a stringency index of government-imposed restrictions, and epidemiological data, this study explores how governmental policies and the pandemic influenced public opinion. Key findings suggest that while stricter measures generally decreased satisfaction, increased concern about the pandemic mitigated this effect. Additionally, political and regional differences played significant roles in shaping public attitudes.

## Project Description
This repository contains the replication code for the analysis discussed in the senior thesis titled **"Satisfaction with Democracy in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic"**. The thesis evaluates the impact of government-imposed restrictions and the pandemic itself on how Canadians view democracy. The analysis includes:
- Regression models to assess the effects of government policy stringency.
- Examination of demographic and political influences on public opinion.
- Interpretations of how variations in pandemic concern modify perceptions of democracy.

## How to Run the Code
1. Download the RScript for replication code
2. At this time the data is not publicly available, you will need to request it from the [Media Ecosystems Observatory](https://www.mediaecosystemobservatory.com/).
